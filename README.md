# Mousetail-s-roguelike
A roguelike I have been working on. Link to blog: http://www.gamedev.net/blog/2005-mousetails-rpg/.

Work started in august 2014

Most of the components and basic arcitecture can be found in design folder.

Instructions for running:
You need python 2.7 installed, and a recent pygame distribution. Open src/3d_render.py with pythonw.exe. It should work.

Hirarchy:
 * Art: most graphics.
 * Src: most code
 * Data: some combat system related files, currently only used as reference when writing code
 * Design: A couple of documents relating to how the project should work, and a nice .png explaining what is in what code file
 * Screenshots: A couple of screenshots.
Only Art and Src are needed to run the project.
